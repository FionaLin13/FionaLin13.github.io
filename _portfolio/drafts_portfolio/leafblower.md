### üçÉ Dual-Battery Leaf Blower Redesign ‚Äì Milwaukee Tool Internship

**Goal:**  
During my Summer 2023 internship at Milwaukee Tool, I was tasked with redesigning a dual-battery leaf blower with two key objectives:  
1. **Reduce weight and improve ergonomics**  
2. **Integrate Milwaukee‚Äôs new in-house brushless motor**  
This also required redesigning the blower fan to optimize performance within new spatial constraints.

**My Role & Contributions:**  
I owned the full design pipeline, from research to prototype delivery:
- Reverse-engineered existing Milwaukee and competitor products to identify design inspiration and patent boundaries
- Defined functional requirements based on ergonomic principles, performance goals, and manufacturability
- Identified major weight contributors and restructured battery placement to reduce torque on the user's wrist
- Shaved excess material from the housing while maintaining structural integrity
- Collaborated with the aerodynamics and motor engineering teams to implement a new fan and integrate the in-house motor
- Designed the prototype in Siemens NX, optimized components in ANSYS, and built a physical prototype with 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf hardware

**Tools & Skills Used:**  
Siemens NX, Teamcenter, ANSYS (FEA and CFD), 3D printing, hand tools, electronics bench equipment, manufacturing design for injection molding

**Challenges & Solutions:**  
- Fan geometry was extremely difficult to model in CAD; I worked closely with experts and iterated designs to balance realism and printability  
- Ensured parts were not just printable, but also moldable ‚Äî requiring multiple design revisions  
- Managed tight timelines by proactively checking in with my manager and resolving bottlenecks quickly

**Outcome:**  
The final prototype was **30% lighter** than the previous model and ergonomically superior due to better weight distribution. While the electronics failed during testing (outside my domain), the mechanical design and aerodynamic performance exceeded expectations. I presented my findings and prototype to company leadership at the end of the internship.

**What I Learned:**  
This project gave me hands-on experience with full-cycle mechanical product design, aerodynamic optimization, and design-for-manufacture. I also sharpened my skills in project scoping, cross-functional collaboration, and time management ‚Äî and still finished early enough to study linear algebra and connect with some truly brilliant colleagues.

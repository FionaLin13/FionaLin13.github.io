Context: this is a class project for 2.680, marine autonomy. This is a team project where I work with a teammate and program scout and swimmer robots to search and rescue floaters on the charles river. My role was to program the scout robot. I used the MOOS_IVP software package written in C++.

What, how, why: We were one of the best team in the class, and the key was in following the engineering design process. The search and rescue mission was a competition. While our team is searching, another team is also searching so there is an incentive for strategies for faster searches. However, we had very little time to simulate the algorithms and there were many unknown variables for a field deployment. I also know from experience that intergration will take longer than expected. So after listing out the potential strategies, we picked the one that is the easiest to implement and the most robust to errors. This proved to be a good strategy - some other teams has new issues pop up on the day of the competition, but we already had everything flushed out.

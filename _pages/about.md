## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate with a strong focus in **controls, instrumentation, and robotics**. Iâ€™m passionate about building systems that combine hardware and software â€” whether that means designing a robot from scratch, programming an FPGA to simulate life, or debugging a circuit thatâ€™s just barely holding it together (but still works!).

I enjoy thinking across disciplines â€” from **mechanical design** and **electronics** to **embedded systems** and **autonomous behavior**. Iâ€™ve worked with everything from hand tools and mills to Verilog and Arduino, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to bridge physical and digital systems.

Some roles Iâ€™m currently interested in include **Robotics Engineer**, **Mechatronics Engineer**, **Control Systems Engineer**, and **Field Engineer**, but Iâ€™m excited by the unexpected â€” Iâ€™m open to new fields and challenges.

Outside of engineering, I love solving tricky problems, collaborating with creative people, and occasionally making things that emit **accidentally demonic sounds** (ask me about the Game of Life on FPGA).

Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to explore my projects, or [get in touch](#contact)!
